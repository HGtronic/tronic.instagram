   - add your username on line 7 `user_name = 'type-your-username-here'`
   - add your password on line 8 `user_password = 'type-your-password-here'`
   - save the file
* Execute the script by running `python3 automation/like_unlike_user_post.py`
* In the terminal type:
   - the instagram account url e.g. `https://www.instagram.com/natgeo/`
   - the action either `like` or `unlike`
